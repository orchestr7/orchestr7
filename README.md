### Hi there 👋

![My GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=akuleshov7&theme=default)

My name is Andrey Kuleshov, I am the software developer with 7+ years of professional
experience in the industry. I have graduated from the MSU (top#1 Russian University).
Worked in well-known companies like Intel, Deutsche Bank, Huawei.
Developed mostly everything: from the optimizing c/c++ compilers to high-loaded
Java-applications for invest banking. From linters for Python and Kotlin to BigData applications on Scala/Spark.
A fan of JVM-world, C++ hater. Feel myself as opensource and Kotlin enthusiast (fake news). The creator of [**diktat**](https://github.com/cqfn/diktat) project.

**Tags:** #kotlin #java #static-analysis 

See my [**blog**](http://akuleshov7.com/) or my [**CV**](https://github.com/akuleshov7/CV) to know more about me.

🔭 I’m currently working on:
* [**save**](https://github.com/cqfn/save) - a kotlin native framework for testing of static analyzers and compilers
* [**diktat**](https://github.com/cqfn/diktat) - static analyzer and formatter for Kotlin

👯 I’m looking for some opensource tools for developers, like compilers and static analyzers,
where we can setup our [**save**](https://github.com/cqfn/save) framework.
